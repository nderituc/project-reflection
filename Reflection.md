# Reflection

My most successful parts of the course have been.
* Use of github and markdown.
* Data visualization with with ggplot2.
* Data transformation e.g pivoting.
* use of tibbles,data import and tidying data.
* Dealing with R packages


My most exciting 
* Data visualisation
* Github.
* Data transformation.
* Tidying data.
* Building models and simulations
* Bootsrapping



Challenges
* Abit of statistical modelling and simulation. 
* Creating a shiny app is the biggest challenge for me.
* 

I have learnt how to-
```
* Create or fork a git project,clone it to R-studio and commit it back to git.
* Install r packages and load them using install.package() and library() functuions respectively.
* Tidy data using pivot longer and pivot wider and also separating data into multiple columns as well as uniting columns using separate() and unite() functions respectively.
* Do data transformation using various functions of the dplyr package ie
* import data and tidy
* filter() to pick observations by value.
* arrange() to reorder rows.
* select() to pick variables by name.
* mutate() to create variables within existing variables.
* summarise() to  put values in a single summary.
* group_by haven't used but i know it exists.
* Do data visualization using ggplot2 package and ggplot function.I can work with various geoms and map many  aesthetics on the plots.
* Read data using read_csv function.
* create data pipes.
* Do data summaries in addition to visualization.
* Combine data from various sources.
* How write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments.
*  How to use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.Not so sure about this but i can extend R programs using source documentation.
```


Course objectives achieved
* To import,manage and clean data.Not sure about managing data but i can import and clean data efficiently.
* I can create summaries of data and do various visualizations.
* I can write clear R programs and document them.
* How write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments.
* How to use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.Not so sure about this but i can extend R programs using source documentation.

Generally i feel am at a good position in this class.The classe have been great.The weekly activities have been help in practicing the topics.By challenge has been creating a shiny app.Grade A
